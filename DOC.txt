Web Development: 

➡️ Web development is the process of designing, developing, and maintaining applications using frontend technologies for user interaction,
    backend technologies for processing, and databases for storage.
1. Web development involves Frontend (UI/UX & interactivity), Backend (server-side logic & processing), and Database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. A full-stack developer works on both frontend (React, Vue, etc.) and backend (Node.js, Express, etc.)
3. Key technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB
4. Modern web apps often use frameworks like React (frontend), Express (backend), and Ruby on Rails (alternative backend framework)


➡️
What are the main parts of a web application?
🔹Frontend (UI, responsiveness, design), Backend (processing, authentication, APIs), Database (storage, queries, transactions)

What’s the difference between frontend and backend?
✅ Frontend: Runs in the browser, interacts with the user.
✅ Backend: Runs on a server, processes logic, and manages data.

Why do we use frameworks like React instead of plain JavaScript?

1. React is a library (not a framework).
2. React makes development faster, modular, and efficient by allowing reusable components and managing UI efficiently using a Virtual DOM.
What’s an API, and why is it important in web development?
🔹 API (Application Programming Interface) allows different parts of an application to communicate.
🔹 It’s important because it enables frontend and backend communication (e.g., Fetching data from a database).

What role does a database play in a web app?
✅ Stores and retrieves data efficiently.
✅ Allows manipulation, queries, and transactions (like user authentication, product listings, etc.).
